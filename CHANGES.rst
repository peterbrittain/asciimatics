  - Button
  - CheckBox
  - Divider
  - Label
  - ListBox
  - RadioButtons
  - Text
  - TextBox

1.4.1
-----
- Minor fixes to setup.py to correct packaging meta-data.

1.4.0
-----
- Added Fire renderer and demo.
- Added Mouse support.  This had 2 major impacts:

  1. It meant that blessed support is now completely deprecated as it doesn't
     support mouse input.
  2. All references to processing keys is now deprecated.  You must now use the
     `get_event()` equivalent API instead.

- Added support for dynamic addition/removal of Effects from a Scene, using
  `add_effect()` and `remove_effect()`.
- Converted all effects to use `**kwargs` to pass through to base Effect class
  so that future common frame related features were instantly available.  These
  parameters must now always be specified as keyword arguments as a result.
- Added support for background colours.
- Renamed `getch()` and `putch()` to `get_from()` and `print_at()`.  Old
  functions are still present, but deprecated.
- Fixed up `get_from()` so that it is consistent across all platforms and
  includes all character attributes.

1.3.0
-----
- Added BarChart renderer and demo.
- Added support for extended key codes on Windows and Linux.
- Added support for dynamic paths using keyboard input.  Created interactive
  demo sample to show how this works.

  Renderer should now use StaticRenderer.
- Added speed option to Print effect.
- Fixed up curses colour detection and Unicode bug in python2 on Windows.

1.2.0
-----

  required screen set up.  The old from_XXX class methods are now deprecated.

- Added support for Python 3.

1.0.0
-----

- Added Random Noise effect.
- Added support for blessed as well as curses - if you want to continue to
  use curses, construct the Screen using the `from_curses()` class method.
- Fixed up some docs errors.

0.4.0
-----
- Added support for 256 colour terminals.
- Moved ${c,a} syntax for inline colouring from Screen to Renderer.
