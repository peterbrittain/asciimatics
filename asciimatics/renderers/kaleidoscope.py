    """
    Renderer to create a 2-mirror kaleidoscope effect.

    This is a chained renderer (i.e. it acts upon the output of another Renderer which is
    passed to it on construction).  The other Renderer is used as the cell that is rotated over
    time to create the animation.

    You can specify the desired rotational symmetry of the kaleidoscope (which determines the
    angle between the mirrors).  If you chose values of less than 2, you are effectively removing
    one or both mirrors, thus either getting the original cell or a simple mirrored image of the
    cell.

    Since this renderer rotates the background cell, it needs operate on square pixels, which
    means each character in the cell is drawn as 2 next to each other on the screen.  In other
    words the cell needs to be half the width of the desired output (when measured in text
    characters).
